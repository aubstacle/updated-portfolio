# MY PORTFOLIO WEBPAGE - HOMEWORK 03

I hope you enjoy my responsive portfolio webpage! 

A few of the things I really couldn't figure out: 

1) once sized down enough, my navbar changes from 3 separate pages to one clickable dropdown button that I couldnt get to work. 

2) I couldn't get my name to be white font in the top left corner

3) I couldn't for the life of me get to call on the body in my CSS and place the repeating background image in there, so I left it in the HTML where it (kindof) worked. 

I ran my code thru a code validator and only got a few errors pertaining to what I mentioned.
